In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, creating interactive and visually appealing applications has become a necessity. Recently, I undertook the exciting project of building a car show web app using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js 13, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This article will walk you through the key steps of the development process and share some valuable insights.


Getting Started

To kick off the project, I utilized the efficient Next.js framework. Leveraging the latest version, Next.js 13, brought about a significant enhancement in client-side rendering capabilities, providing a seamless experience for users interacting with the application.

Organizing the Project Structure

One notable decision in organizing the project structure was to create a dedicated "components" folder in the root directory. This approach aligns with the new Next.js 13 syntax, where only pages, layouts, and specific files representing routes are placed inside the "app" folder.

Client-Side Rendering and Troubleshooting

Given that Next.js defaults to server-side rendering, encountering errors prompted a crucial realization: for enhanced interactivity, certain components must be converted to client components. The remedy was a simple addition of "Use client" to transition these components seamlessly to the client side.

Introducing Animation with Framer Motion

To elevate the user interface, Framer Motion, a powerful animation library, was integrated. This library, combined with the ComboBox and Transition components from Headless UI, contributed to a dynamic and engaging visual experience.

npm install @headlessui/react

Fetching Data with Headless UI and Tailwind CSS

Implementing Headless UI in conjunction with Tailwind CSS streamlined the process of fetching data. The ComboBox and Transition components are seamlessly integrated with Tailwind styles, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

export async function fetchCars() {
  // API fetch implementation
}




External APIs for Car Images

For an immersive experience, I incorporated car images from the Imagin Studio Car Image API. This addition enriched the application with vibrant visuals, enhancing the overall user engagement.

State Management and Deployment Considerations

Managing state with `useState` required the inclusion of "Use client" to align with the client-side rendering paradigm. Before deploying to GitHub, it's crucial to address TypeScript errors. Adding the following configuration to `next.config.js` proved instrumental in preventing build errors:

typescript: {
  ignoreBuildErrors: true
}



Deployment on Vercel

Given that Next.js is developed by Vercel, deploying the web app to Vercel was a natural choice. The seamless integration and hosting capabilities provided by Vercel simplified the deployment process.

In conclusion, building a dynamic car show web app with Next.js 13, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS was a rewarding journey. The amalgamation of these technologies resulted in an application that not only performs efficiently but also delivers an engaging user experience. Feel free to explore the live application and the source code on GitHub to gain insights into the implementation details. Happy coding!
